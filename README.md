<h6>Description</h6>
                            <p>
                                This is a descriptive analytics project which is focused on uncovering trends and insights from classical music live-performance data.
                                The data was aggregated from multiple sources, namely the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

                            <h6>Motivation</h6>
                            <p>
                                Having worked in the music industry for several years, and being a regular classical-music concertgoer, 
                                I was curious to uncover trends in artistic programming, composers, conductors and other live performance information.
                                <br><br>
                                Were some of the composers we celebrate today appreciated in their own time? 
                                Was there always an unsaid rule that concerts are to begin at 8pm?
                                Are there works once fashionable that are not in style anymore, and on the flip side, are there works that are time-agnostic?
                                These were just some of the questions I was itching to find out more about.

                            <h6>Business Context</h6>
                            <p>
                                In my opinion, data analysis is not being used nearly enough by arts organizations as it could and should be.
                                I can't tell you how many times I have gotten into discussions with peers, professors and classmates over how arts organizations should be appropriately reacting to declining audiences
                                , where even basic facts of the business are in debate.
                                Data-based decision making building on this analysis (along with some predictive modelling) can help answer questions such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Artistic Programming - What repertoire should we perform and when?</li>
                                    <li>Determining demand for Conductors and Soloists - What price are we willing to pay for conductors and soloist?</li>
                                    <li>Scheduling of Performances - What day and what time is optimal controlled for audience type and repertoire</li>
                                </ul>
                                Data science can also be greatly utilized in both marketing as well as development (fundraising).
                                Too often I think, we in the music world over rely on experience and heuristically make decisions (often based on our own assumptions). 
                                I think decision-makers could benefit from data-based evidence in conjunction with past experience and instinct.

                                This project did not present any serious technical challenges or barriers. 
                                However, I do think this project tested my citical thinking skills and pushed to think of creative ways value could be extracted from this data. 
                                More of my time was devoted to asking myself how this data could be useful rather than looking something up on stackoverflow or medium.
                                Although I did this project more for curiosity than anything else and it was interesting to just discover interesting facts about the history of live orchestral music, 
                                I ultimately believe that the purpose of this kind of analytics is to provide value to an organization.
                                Building on the kind of thinking I used in this project and expanding my perpsective to ask myself even more pertinent questions will, I think, make me a much better and more valuable data scientist.
